# Project 5 – Architecture Notes (Draft)

This document will describe:

- How Argo CD ApplicationSet generates Applications for:
  - project5-dev
  - project5-prod
- How those applications reference the existing Helm chart (from Project 4).
- Dev: automated sync.
- Prod: manual sync with promotion from dev.

An SVG diagram (architecture.svg) will be added here later.
